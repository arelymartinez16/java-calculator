# CMP167 Calculator Project

## Description

This console-based calculator project was developed in my freshman year at Lehman College. This was the first project I have ever done in Java. The project showcases my exploration into fundamental Java concepts and programming logic.

### Key Features

- Standard mode will allow the user to perform the following operations: (+, -, *, /) add, subtract, multiply, and divide
- Scientific mode will allow the user to perform the same functionality as the Standard Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide (+, -, *, / ) plus the following: sin x, cos x, tan x. (sin x, cos x, tan x)
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two or more numbers but perform sin x, cos x, and tan x of one number only (the number is in radians).
